<p style="color: mediumseagreen">The Scarlet macaw, also known as, Ara Macao, is a large Neotropical parrot with bright red, yellow, and blue feathers. Its native range is South and Central America. As its name implies, this tree is native to the wet evergreen forests of the Neotropics. While habitat destruction and capture due to the pet parrot trade have led to its extinction in certain areas, the species is still found in large numbers in other areas. Like its close relative, the blue and yellow macaw, the scarlet macaw is a popular pet bird because of its vibrant plumage. </p>
